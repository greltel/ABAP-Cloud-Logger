## Motivation for Creating the Repository

Logging is a tool I rely on almost every day while working with ABAP. I wanted to create a version that is not only simple and effective but also fully compatible with the ABAP Cloud environment. 
The goal is to provide an easy-to-use logger that fits naturally into cloud-ready development practices and can be integrated seamlessly into modern projects.
